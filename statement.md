# Expense Tracker – Project Statement

## *Problem Statement*
Managing personal or small-business expenses can be challenging when relying on handwritten notes, scattered spreadsheets, or memory. Users often struggle to track where their money goes, categorize spending, or review past expenses efficiently. This project solves that problem by providing a simple desktop-based Expense Tracker that stores, displays, and manages expense records using a graphical interface and a local SQLite database.

## *Scope of the Project*
The project focuses on building a lightweight, user-friendly expense management system using Python’s Tkinter library. Its scope includes:

- Providing an interface for users to input daily expenses.
- Saving all expenses securely in an SQLite database.
- Enabling basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Displaying all records in a table for easy viewing.
- Supporting basic data validation and user confirmations.
- Offering textual (“sentence-form”) interpretations of expenses.

The project does *not* include:
- Cloud synchronization
- Multi-user accounts
- Advanced analytics or charts
- Mobile or web functionality

- Individuals who want to keep track of daily expenses.
- Students managing budgets.
- Freelancers or small-business owners who want a simple offline record-keeping tool.

If you’d like, I can also generate a nicely formatted PDF, README, or other documentation files.
